			<h2>Facts about economic inequality in the U.S.</h2>
			<h:graphicImage value="resources/img/eco1.jpg"></h:graphicImage>
			<p>Rising economic inequality in the United States has become a central issue in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and discussions about policy interventions that might help address it are likely to remain at the forefront in the 2020 general election.
				As these debates continue, here are some basic facts about how economic inequality has changed over time and how the U.S. compares globally.

				<h3>In Jail for water? Really?</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>
					A recent example of social inequality was a law in Georgia that passed that made it illegal to give 
					water to people in line to vote. This has been highly controversial so far. Many people believe that 
					it should be legal to give someone water period. Some believe that this is an attempt to suppress 
					voters. This is a very worrying trend since democracy has been fundamental to out modern way of 
					living and the world in general. Here is a link to a CNN news source if you would like to read more:

				<h3>Rich People Don't Have All The Answers</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Many rich people do not seem to understand how they can help those less fortunate than themselves. 
					Some solutions to homelessness treat the symptoms rather than the problems. A notorious solution 
					is homeless spikes. People spent money to simply deter people from hanging around a certain area. 
					Instead of, y'know, just giving people that money?

				<h3>Never Let A Good Tragedy Go To Waste</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The current pandemic also highlights many problems of economic inequality. Many billionaires 
					have become even richer as things unfolded. As memey as it is the Gamestop fiasco represents 
					something greater in our society. People are realizing that they can play the same game as 
					the big hedge funds and billionaires. I hope that people realize that together on the stock 
					market that they have real power.
