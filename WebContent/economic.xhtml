		<p>A recent example of social inequality was a law in 
		Georgia that passed that made it illegal to give water to 
		people in line to vote.  This has been highly controversial 
		so far.  Many people believe that it should be legal to 
		give someone water period.  Some believe that this is an 
		attempt to suppress voters.  This is a very worrying trend since 
		democracy has been fundamental to out modern way of living
		and the world in general.  Here is a link to a CNN news source 
		if you would like to read more: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/26/politics/georgia-voting-law-food-drink-ban-trnd/index.html">CNN</a>

		Many rich people do not seem to understand how they can help those
		less fortunate than themselves.  Some solutions to homelessness
		treat the symptoms rather than the problems.  A notorious solution
		is homeless spikes.  People spent money to simply deter people 
		from hanging around a certain area.  Instead of, y'know, just giving
		people that money? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/defensive-architecture-keeps-poverty-undeen-and-makes-us-more-hostile">Link</a>

		The current pandemic also highlights many problems of economic 
		inequality.  Many billionaires have become even richer as things
		unfolded.  As memey as it is the Gamestop fiasco represents
		something greater in our society.  People are realizing that they
		can play the same game as the big hedge funds and billionaires.
		I hope that people realize that together on the stock market that 
		they have real power.
